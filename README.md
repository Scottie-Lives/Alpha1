# Alpha1
The beginning of owning up to my responsibilities as a man, husband, father and gifted developer and to share the talents and experience I have with anyone that might benefit from it. To be honest, open minded and willing to learn new life strategies, how not to be a perfectionist, and to put enough discipline and structure in my life that I don't get lost when I run free.
